# Exploring the History of Lego

## Project Description

In this project, I explore the [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database and answer a series of questions related to the history of Lego! This database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold: the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what colour the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data!

The data is available as .csv files (the schema is in the notebook).

## Project tasks

This project focuses on simple data exploration by employing various **data manipulation** and **data visualization** techniques with **Python** and **pandas**. The main tasks are as follows:

- Determine the number of unique brick colours.
- Compare the distribution of transparent vs non-transparent colours.
- Visualize how the average number of parts in Lego sets has varied over the years.
- Determine how the number of themes shipped has varied over the years.
- Identify how many unique themes were released in the year of 1999 when Lego introduced the first licenced Star Wars set.
